# Installing MetaMask

## Overview

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain applications. This guide will walk you through installing and setting up MetaMask for use in this workshop.

## Why MetaMask?

For our workshop on blockchain protocols and distributed applications, MetaMask provides:

- A secure wallet for storing cryptocurrency and tokens
- Connection to Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and other EVM-compatible networks
- Ability to interact with decentralized applications (dApps)
- Signing transactions for smart contract deployment and interaction

## Installation Process

### 1. Browser Extension Installation

MetaMask is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.

1. Visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Click "Install MetaMask for [Your Browser]"
3. You'll be redirected to your browser's extension store
4. Click "Add to [Browser]" or "Install"
5. After installation, the MetaMask fox icon will appear in your browser's toolbar

### 2. Creating a New Wallet

After installing the extension:

1. Click on the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Select "Create a new wallet"
4. Create a password for your wallet (this is for accessing MetaMask on your device)
   - Use a strong, unique password
   - This is separate from your recovery phrase
5. Agree to the terms of use

### 3. Securing Your Recovery Phrase

This is a CRITICAL step:

1. MetaMask will generate a 12-word recovery phrase (seed phrase)
2. Click "Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase" and write these words down in order
3. Store this phrase securely offline - preferably in multiple physical locations
4. **NEVER share this phrase with anyone or store it digitally**
5. Complete the verification by selecting the words in the correct order

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: If you lose your recovery phrase, you will permanently lose access to your wallet and all funds. There is no "forgot password" option for blockchain wallets.

### 4. Wallet Configuration

Your wallet is now set up! You should see a screen with:
- Your account address (a long string starting with 0x...)
- An ETH balance (initially 0)
- Options to buy, send, and swap cryptocurrencies
